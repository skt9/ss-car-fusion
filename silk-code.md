## SILK code documentation
- To prepare silk for refer to this page: [Silk Setup](https://github.com/facebookresearch/silk/blob/main/doc/usage/setup.md)
#### To run silk inference on a pair of images
- The script to run is `./examples/silk-inference.py.`
- To change the input images: replace `IMAGE_0_PATH` and `IMAGE_1_PATH`.
- I copied the script to the main project folder to run it. I also copied `common.py` to it.
